# Normalization

## First Normal Form
- We checked that all our entities/tables has atleast one primary key.

## Second Normal Form
- We checked that for every entity/table, all non-key columns depend on the primary key or the whole composite primary key.

## Third Normal Form
- We checked that for every entity/table, all non-key columns don't depend on another non-key column and only depend on primary key(s).

## Boyce-Codd Normal Form
- We checked that for every entity/table, all any column A that depends on a column B, then B is unique.
